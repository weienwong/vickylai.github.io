      <description>From now on, my tweets are ephemeral. Here’s why I’m deleting all my old tweets and the AWS Lambda function that does it for free.
Click here to skip to the code part.
Stuff and opinions I’ve only been a one-bag nomad for a little over a year and a half. Before that, I lived as most people do in an apartment or a house. I owned furniture, more clothing than I strictly needed, and enough “stuff” to fill at least a few moving boxes.</description>

      <description>I’m a nomad and live out of one carry-on bag. This means that the total weight of all my worldly possessions must fall under airline cabin baggage weight limits - usually 10kg. On some smaller airlines, however, this weight limit drops to 7kg. Occasionally, I have to decide not to bring something with me to adjust to the smaller weight limit.
As a practical exercise, deciding what to leave behind (or get rid of altogether) entails laying out all my things and choosing which ones to keep.</description>

      <description>If you read About time, you’ll know that I’m a big believer in spending time now on building things that save time in the future. To this end I built a simple Twitter bot in Go that would occasionally post links to my articles and keep my account interesting even when I’m too busy to use it. The tweets help drive traffic to my sites, and I don’t have to lift a finger.</description>

      <description>I started blogging about my nomadic travels last year, and so far the habit has stuck. Like all side projects, I won’t typically invest heavily in setting up web properties before I can be reasonably certain that such an investment is worth my time or enjoyment. In other words: don’t buy the domain until you’ve proven to yourself that you’ll stick with it!
After some months of regular posting I felt I was ready to commit (short courtship, I know, but we’re all adults here) and I bought a dedicated domain, herOneBag.</description>

      <description>Full transparency: I occasionally waste time messing around on Twitter. (Gasp! Shock!) One of the ways I waste time messing around on Twitter is by writing my name in my profile with different unicode character “fonts,” 𝖑𝖎𝖐𝖊 𝖙𝖍𝖎𝖘 𝖔𝖓𝖊. I previously did this by searching for different unicode characters on Google, then one-by-one copying and pasting them into the “Name” field on my Twitter profile. Since this method of wasting time was a bit of a time waster, I decided (in true programmer fashion) to write a tool that would help me save some time while wasting it.</description>

      <description>Some time ago I decided to stop freeloading on GitHub pages and move my static page for vickylai.com to Amazon Web Services (AWS). It turns out that I’m still mostly freeloading (yay free tier) so it amounted to a learning experience. Here are the components that let me host and serve the site at my custom domain with HTTPS.
 Static site in Amazon Web Services S3 bucket Route 53 handling the DNS CloudFront for distribution and a custom SSL certificate  I set all that up most of a year ago.</description>

      <description>This morning I read an article that’s been making the rounds lately: Modern Media Is a DoS Attack on Your Free Will.
It’s made me think, which I must admit, I at first didn’t like. See, when I wake up in the morning (and subsequently wake up my computer) the first thing I do is go on Twitter to catch up on everything I missed while I was asleep. All this before my first coffee, mind you.</description>

      <description>What if I told you that by the end of this article, you’ll be able to calculate the orbital period of satellites around Earth using their average altitudes and… You tuned out already, didn’t you?
Okay, how about this: I’m going to teach you how to make paella!
And you’ll have written a function that does the stuff I mentioned above, just like I did for this freeCodeCamp challenge.</description>

            Making sandwiches with closures in JavaScript

      <description>Say you’re having a little coding get-together, and you need some sandwiches. You happen to know that everyone prefers a different type of sandwich, like chicken, ham, or peanut butter and mayo. You could make all these sandwiches yourself, but that would be tedious and boring.
Luckily, you know of a nearby sandwich shop that delivers. They have the ability and ingredients to make any kind of sandwich in the world, and all you have to do is order through their app.</description>

      <description>I was having trouble understanding reduce() and recursion in JavaScript, so I wrote this article to explain it to myself (hey, look, recursion!). I hope you find my examples both helpful and delicious.
Given an array with nested arrays:
var arr = [1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]  We want to produce this:
var flat = [1, 2, 3, 4]  Using for loops and if statements Naively, if we know the maximum number of nested arrays we’ll encounter (there are 4 in this example), we can use for loops to iterate through each array item, then if statements to check if each item is in itself an array, and so on…</description>

      <description>Here’s some complaining a quick overview of some code that has confounded me more than once. I’m told even very experienced developers encounter these situations regularly, so if you find yourself on your third cup of coffee scratching your head over why your code is doing exactly what you told it to do (and not what you want it to do), maybe this post can help you.
The example code is JavaScript, since that’s what I’ve been working in lately, but I believe the concepts to be pretty universal.</description>

      <description>This week, I launched my new website and changed my Twitter username to match. I was about to spend time going through all my old blog posts to find and update the URLs when this very future blog post popped up on my screen like Clippy and shook its pixelated head disapprovingly.
Here’s a worthwhile new habit for you: anytime you find yourself going “Ughhh I have to do that?</description>

      <description>I’m frequently asked for my opinion on how to get started on being a freelance developer. If you’re hoping to live the life of a remote working digital nomad, whichever career you choose, having a little coding expertise in your back pocket will be a big benefit.
Here’s a quick list of resources that you should definitely look at first if you’re hoping to gain some coding superpowers for free.</description>

      <description>I recently attended a panel discussion hosted by General Assembly in Singapore entitled, “So you want to be a Data Scientist/Analyst”. The panel featured professionals in different stages of their careers and offered a wealth of information to an audience of hopefuls, including tips on how to land a job as a data scientist, and stories debunking myths that color this field.
