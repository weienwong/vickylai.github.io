When I was a kid, I thought I knew what I wanted to do with my life.
I spent entire summers in front of a CRT, developing astigmatism
and a text-based RPG. I connected via Telnet and wrote in LPC.
I made tools, monsters, characters, worlds,
and decided it couldn't get any better than this.

I wanted to make things, so I got a fine arts degree.
I made props, costumes, sets, and scripts,
and I made actors happy. I lit stages and arranged amps,
managed people and shows and theatres and businesses.
I made minimum wage
and decided it couldn't get any better than this.

People told me I was good at managing businesses
and would I please come and work for them? So I traded
stage shows for startups (they aren't that different)
and moved halfway around the world
and I loved Asia and managing projects
and I really missed making things.

So I :quit
and recreated myself
as a character in a new world:
