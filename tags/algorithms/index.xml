      <description>Just like writing your very first for loop, understanding time complexity is an integral milestone to learning how to write efficient complex programs. Think of it as having a superpower that allows you to know exactly what type of program might be the most efficient in a particular situation - before even running a single line of code.
The fundamental concepts of complexity analysis are well worth studying. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to better understand how the code you&amp;rsquo;re writing will interact with the program&amp;rsquo;s input, and as a result, you&amp;rsquo;ll spend a lot less wasted time writing slow and problematic code.</description>

      <description>The knapsack problem I&amp;rsquo;m a nomad and live out of one carry-on bag. This means that the total weight of all my worldly possessions must fall under airline cabin baggage weight limits - usually 10kg. On some smaller airlines, however, this weight limit drops to 7kg. Occasionally, I have to decide not to bring something with me to adjust to the smaller weight limit.
As a practical exercise, deciding what to leave behind (or get rid of altogether) entails laying out all my things and choosing which ones to keep.</description>

      <description>Full transparency: I occasionally waste time messing around on Twitter. (Gasp! Shock!) One of the ways I waste time messing around on Twitter is by writing my name in my profile with different Unicode character &amp;ldquo;fonts,&amp;rdquo; ùñëùñéùñêùñä ùñôùñçùñéùñò ùñîùñìùñä. I previously did this by searching for different Unicode characters on Google, then one-by-one copying and pasting them into the &amp;ldquo;Name&amp;rdquo; field on my Twitter profile. Since this method of wasting time was a bit of a time waster, I decided (in true programmer fashion) to write a tool that would help me save some time while wasting it.</description>

      <description>What if I told you that by the end of this article, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to calculate the orbital period of satellites around Earth using their average altitudes and&amp;hellip; You tuned out already, didn&amp;rsquo;t you?
Okay, how about this: I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach you how to make paella!
And you&amp;rsquo;ll have written a function that does the stuff I mentioned above, just like I did for this freeCodeCamp challenge.</description>
