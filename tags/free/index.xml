      <description>If you read About time, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that I&amp;rsquo;m a big believer in spending time now on building things that save time in the future. To this end I built a simple Twitter bot in Go that would occasionally post links to my articles and keep my account interesting even when I&amp;rsquo;m too busy to use it. The tweets help drive traffic to my sites, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to lift a finger.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I decided to stop freeloading on GitHub pages and move my static page for &lt;a href=&#34;https://vickylai.com&#34;&gt;vickylai.com&lt;/a&gt; to Amazon Web Services (AWS). It turns out that I&amp;rsquo;m still mostly freeloading (yay free tier) so it amounted to a learning experience. Here are the components that let me host and serve the site at my custom domain with HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I ditched WordPress and set up my custom domain HTTPS site for (almost) free</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got annoyed with WordPress.com. While using the service has its pros (like https and a mobile responsive website, and being very visual and beginner-friendly) it&amp;rsquo;s limiting. For someone who&amp;rsquo;s comfortable enough to be tweaking CSS but who&amp;rsquo;s not interested in creating their own theme (or paying upwards of $50 for one), I felt I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really the type of consumer WordPress.com was suited to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
