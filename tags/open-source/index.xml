      <description>A history of clean commits can be evidence of a lot of things: attention to detail, good work ethic, and genuine investment in the project. What do your Git commits say about you?
If, like me, there might be one or two less than stellar ones, well, we&amp;rsquo;re only human. A nice part of being human is having the ability to learn new and complex things fairly quickly, and continuously improve ourselves.</description>

      <description>A little while ago I wrote about a Lambda function I called ephemeral for deleting my old tweets. While it&amp;rsquo;s a great project for someone familiar with or wanting to learn to use Lambda, it isn&amp;rsquo;t simple for a non-technical person to set up. There are services out there that will delete your tweets for you, but require your access credentials. There didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be anything that provided convenience without also requiring authentication.</description>

      <description>From now on, my tweets are ephemeral. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm deleting all my old tweets, and the AWS Lambda function I‚Äôm using to do all this for free.

Stuff and opinions I&amp;rsquo;ve only been a one-bag nomad for a little over a year and a half. Before that, I lived as most people do in an apartment or a house. I owned furniture, more clothing than I strictly needed, and enough &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; to fill at least a few moving boxes.</description>

      <description>Full transparency: I occasionally waste time messing around on Twitter. (Gasp! Shock!) One of the ways I waste time messing around on Twitter is by writing my name in my profile with different unicode character &amp;ldquo;fonts,&amp;rdquo; ùñëùñéùñêùñä ùñôùñçùñéùñò ùñîùñìùñä. I previously did this by searching for different unicode characters on Google, then one-by-one copying and pasting them into the &amp;ldquo;Name&amp;rdquo; field on my Twitter profile. Since this method of wasting time was a bit of a time waster, I decided (in true programmer fashion) to write a tool that would help me save some time while wasting it.</description>
